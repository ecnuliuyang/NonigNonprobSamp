Description: This package offers a pseudo-likelihood method for estimating participation probabilities in nonignorable non-probability samples, utilizing auxiliary information from an existing reference probability sample. Additionally, we develop three estimators for the finite population mean, employing regression-based prediction, inverse probability weighting (IPW), and augmented IPW techniques.
